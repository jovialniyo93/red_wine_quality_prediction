# Red Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms#

<br/>

![](/data/download.jpeg)

<br/>


The code in this repository is supplementary to our future publication "Towards Predicting the Quality of Red Wine using Machine Learning Algorithms for Classification Analysis, Data Visualizations and Data Analysis" 




# Design and Implementation details

This project employs the wine dataset for all the conducted procedures. The dataset used includes both white and red wines. There are 4898 samples of white wine and 1599 samples of red wine, and 12 physiochemical variables in each instance of both types of wine. We have "fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulfates, alcohol, and quality rating." The quality rating is based on a sensory test conducted by at least three sommeliers and is scaled in 11 quality classes ranging from 0 (very bad) to 10 (very excellent). 

## Getting Started

**To run the script please use the given files on Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook:**


```scripts``` folder contains all scripts used to train and test models. More details on how to train and test the code is mentioned inside ```scripts``` folder.
